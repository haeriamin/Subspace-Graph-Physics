# Subspace Graph Physics: <br /> Accurate and Real-Time Physics Simulation Approach
#### [[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197624009230)]


Subspace Graph Physics is an <strong>accurate, real-time</strong> engineering approach for large-scale 3D/2D physics simulations.
This is a computationally efficient version of "Learning To Simulate" developed by [DeepMind](https://github.com/google-deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/learning_to_simulate).
This approach can work with a single desktop GPU (with ~10GB vRAM) in training and can perform 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than physics-based methods (with similar accuracy) in inference on CPU.

# Highlights

* We train the graph network (GN) model in subspace by performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

* PCA enables GN to be trained using a single desktop GPU with moderate VRAM for large 3D configurations.

* The training datasets can be generated by our efficient and accurate [Material Point Method](https://github.com/haeriamin/MPM-NGF) (MPM).

* The rollout runtime is under 1 sec/sec, and the training runtime is 60 global-step/sec (on NVIDIA RTX 3080).

* The particle positions and velocities, and rigid body interaction forces are compared in the video above.


# Install and Run Demo
